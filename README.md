# CMin

An example of minimal C/C++ setup using CMake.

CMake automatically determines the language based on the extension (.c vs
.cpp), so the version for C++ is analogous.

This minimal project can be used as a "playground" for C/C++. When you are
done and want to revert back to a previous state,
```
$ git reset --hard HEAD
```
